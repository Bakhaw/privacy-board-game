2. Download and install the [fonts](https://github.com/itidigitalbr/privacy-board-game/blob/master/board/fonts.md).
3. Open one of source files using [vector software](http://www.creativebloq.com/illustrator/alternative-to-illustrator-1131664)
4. Edit the text by translating into your language (if you're using the Illustrator, [unlock the layers](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/locking-hiding-deleting-objects.html) before).
5. When finished, save the file to your computer, upload it to your personal cloud account ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) are good options), get the public link to download the file using your cloud service, **[open an issue](https://github.com/barrosgeraldo/mozsprint-privacy-security-situations/issues/new)** informing that you translated and add the download link.

***We really appreciate your support translating this game, this will enable people in your region to learn about privacy and security in their own local languages.***
